malware detection with CNN (different Architectures)

further tasks:

highly unbalanced dataset

more augmentation

Weighting the loss function so that positive examples is punished less harshly/learns faster (i.e. with a higher scale factor than the other).

Weight contribution of each instance to loss value with inverse class frequency. 

In combination with more Residual Blocks, for keeping still a lower loss.
